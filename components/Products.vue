                It all started with the love for Coffee. I am sure we all accept
                the fact that a day without Coffee is very weird and it makes us
                miss ourselves. I began to search for the best Coffees in my
                Country and that struck a chord! Why not start a coffee shop and
                help people like me who would dance when they take a sip of
                their sweet coffee, first thing in the morning. Yes, Coffee
                makes me feel more alive and nothing can match the aroma of
                freshly ground or brewed Coffee. So, this is how my journey
                started and this pursuit also encouraged me to become an
                entrepreneur to support the people depending on me or the
                hopeless and directionless young lives around me and that's
                where I am now.

              <p class="gray2">For us, Chai is that person who was befriended by Coffee during our journey to start with the Coffee shop. We found that different flavours of Chai work like magic in a personâ€™s body and mind which makes them work their way out, like Coffee. So we now work together to get all the different varieties of Chai that our Country can provide. </p>
